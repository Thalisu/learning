# ArrayBuffer

## Pros

    1. Efficient memory management: Provides contiguous memory blocks, minimizing fragmentation.
    2. Fast access: Direct access to memory allows faster reads and writes.
    3. Predictable performance: Good for consistent data access patterns and structured data.

## Cons

    1. Lack of built-in methods: Does not provide array operations like sorting or searching.
    2. Complexity: More complex to manage than higher-level collections.
    3. Fixed size: Cannot be resized dynamically, unlike ArrayLists.
