# Graph

    A graph is a data structure with nodes (vertices) connected by edges, representing relationships or pathways between elements. an element

### Implementation terms

    Node: A point or vertex on the graph
    Edge: The connection betwixt two nodes

### Graph cycle

    graph cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node without repeating edges, forming a closed loop.

### Big O

    Is commonly stated in terms of V and E where V stands for vertices and E stands for edges. So O(V * E) means that we will check every vertex, and on every vertex we check every edge

#### The grand problem is Memory

## dijkstra

    Algorithm that finds the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph, optimizing distances for efficient navigation.
